            <h2>Why I Joined the Program</h2>
            <p>As technology keeps advancing, the gap between design and code is practically disappearing. This has opened up a huge demand for UX Engineersâ€”people who can mix creativity with technical know-how to create amazing, user-friendly digital experiences. I decided to join Alt School's School of Engineering because it felt like the perfect place to sharpen my tech skills while building on my design background. Their hands-on learning approach is exactly what I need to grow into a UX Engineer who can bring real value to the tech world</p>
